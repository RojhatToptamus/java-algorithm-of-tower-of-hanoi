In this code block i tried to make a mathematical game to show you using of stacks in Java. Tower of Hanoi is the most useful thing to learn Stack structure. If you have any questions please comment.

The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

Only one disk can be moved at a time.
Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
The minimal number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2n âˆ’ 1, where n is the number of disks.

Use this case to test the program:

1. Set size to 3

2. Move from 1 to 2

3. Move from 1 to 2 (error)

4. Move from 1 to 3
